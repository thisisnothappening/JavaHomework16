 create an object and tests for recursive methods:

1) sum of first n integer numbers

2) sum of first n EVEN integers

3) Palindrome: a word that reads the same backwards as forwards, e.g. madam or ana
 - Check if a word is a palindrome in two modes :
         3.1) recursive string reverse
         3.2) recursive check of first and last letter

4) sum of digits for a number

5) fibonacci array:
create a method that will give you the value for the n-th element from fibonacci's array
Fibonaccy array:
F(0) = 0
F(1) = 1
F(i) = F(i-1)+F(i-2)
